    "readme": "# spawn-sync\n\nPolyfill for `child_process.spawnSync`.\n\nOn iojs and node >= 0.12 it will just export the built in `child_process.spawnSync`. On platforms that support compiling native modules it uses the [thread-sleep](https://github.com/ForbesLindesay/thread-sleep) module to wait for an output file to exist in a tight loop.  In this way it gains excellent cross platform support, but don't expect it to be efficient on all platforms.\n\n[![Tests Status](https://img.shields.io/travis/ForbesLindesay/spawn-sync/master.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/ForbesLindesay/spawn-sync)\n[![Dependency Status](https://img.shields.io/david/ForbesLindesay/spawn-sync.svg)](https://david-dm.org/ForbesLindesay/spawn-sync)\n[![NPM version](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/spawn-sync.svg)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/spawn-sync)\n\n## Installation\n\n    npm install spawn-sync\n\nIf this fails, you can try one of the following things:\n\n1. Some package managers made a stupid decision to rename the `node` executable to `nodejs` for their platform.  This breaks compatibility with lots of modules.  If you normally use `nodejs` instead of `node`, you should check out http://stackoverflow.com/questions/18130164/nodejs-vs-node-on-ubuntu-12-04 for possible fixes.\n\n2. You can install using `--unsafe-perm`, which will fix any permissions issues.\n\n    npm install --unsafe-perm spawn-sync\n\n3. You can install using `--ignore-scripts`, which will skip native compilation.  You'll get a warning if you try to require the module, but everything should still work.\n\n    npm install --ignore-scripts spawn-sync\n\n4. You can try [updating npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/installing-node), since this seems to fail on some older versions of npm:\n\n    sudo npm install npm -g\n\n5. You can upgrade to the latest version of node or iojs.  This will make native compilation unnecessary.  You can then use `--ignore-scripts` without getting a warning if you still have trouble.\n\n## Usage\n\n```js\nvar spawnSync = require('spawn-sync');\n\nvar result = spawnSync('node',\n                       ['filename.js'],\n                       {input: 'write this to stdin'});\n\nif (result.status !== 0) {\n  process.stderr.write(result.stderr);\n  process.exit(result.status);\n} else {\n  process.stdout.write(result.stdout);\n  process.stderr.write(result.stderr);\n}\n```\n\n## License\n\n  MIT\n",
