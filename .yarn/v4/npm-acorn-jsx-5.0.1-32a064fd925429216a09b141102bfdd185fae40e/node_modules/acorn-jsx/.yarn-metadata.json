    "readme": "# Acorn-JSX\n\n[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/RReverser/acorn-jsx.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/RReverser/acorn-jsx)\n[![NPM version](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/acorn-jsx.svg)](https://www.npmjs.org/package/acorn-jsx)\n\nThis is plugin for [Acorn](http://marijnhaverbeke.nl/acorn/) - a tiny, fast JavaScript parser, written completely in JavaScript.\n\nIt was created as an experimental alternative, faster [React.js JSX](http://facebook.github.io/react/docs/jsx-in-depth.html) parser.\n\nAccording to [benchmarks](https://github.com/RReverser/acorn-jsx/blob/master/test/bench.html), Acorn-JSX is 2x faster than official [Esprima-based parser](https://github.com/facebook/esprima) when location tracking is turned on in both (call it \"source maps enabled mode\"). At the same time, it consumes all the ES6+JSX syntax that can be consumed by Esprima-FB (this is proved by [official tests](https://github.com/RReverser/acorn-jsx/blob/master/test/tests-jsx.js)).\n\n**UPDATE [14-Apr-2015]**: Facebook implementation started [deprecation process](https://github.com/facebook/esprima/issues/111) in favor of Acorn + Acorn-JSX + Babel for parsing and transpiling JSX syntax.\n\n## Transpiler\n\nPlease note that this tool only parses source code to JSX AST, which is useful for various language tools and services. If you want to transpile your code to regular ES5-compliant JavaScript with source map, check out the [babel transpiler](https://babeljs.io/) which uses `acorn-jsx` under the hood.\n\n## Usage\n\nRequiring this module provides you with an Acorn plugin that you can use like this:\n\n```javascript\nvar acorn = require(\"acorn\");\nvar jsx = require(\"acorn-jsx\");\nacorn.Parser.extend(jsx()).parse(\"my(<jsx/>, 'code');\");\n```\n\nNote that official spec doesn't support mix of XML namespaces and object-style access in tag names (#27) like in `<namespace:Object.Property />`, so it was deprecated in `acorn-jsx@3.0`. If you still want to opt-in to support of such constructions, you can pass the following option:\n\n```javascript\nacorn.Parser.extend(jsx({ allowNamespacedObjects: true }))\n```\n\nAlso, since most apps use pure React transformer, a new option was introduced that allows to prohibit namespaces completely:\n\n```javascript\nacorn.Parser.extend(jsx({ allowNamespaces: false }))\n```\n\nNote that by default `allowNamespaces` is enabled for spec compliancy.\n\n## License\n\nThis plugin is issued under the [MIT license](./LICENSE).\n",
