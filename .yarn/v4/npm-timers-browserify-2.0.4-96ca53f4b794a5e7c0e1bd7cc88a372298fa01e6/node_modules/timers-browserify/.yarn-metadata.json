    "readme": "# Overview\n\nAdds support for the `timers` module to browserify.\n\n## Wait, isn't it already supported in the browser?\n\nThe public methods of the `timers` module are:\n\n* `setTimeout(callback, delay, [arg], [...])`\n* `clearTimeout(timeoutId)`\n* `setInterval(callback, delay, [arg], [...])`\n* `clearInterval(intervalId)`\n\nand indeed, browsers support these already.\n\n## So, why does this exist?\n\nThe `timers` module also includes some private methods used in other built-in\nNode.js modules:\n\n* `enroll(item, delay)`\n* `unenroll(item)`\n* `active(item)`\n\nThese are used to efficiently support a large quantity of timers with the same\ntimeouts by creating only a few timers under the covers.\n\nNode.js also offers the `immediate` APIs, which aren't yet available cross-browser, so we polyfill those:\n\n* `setImmediate(callback, [arg], [...])`\n* `clearImmediate(immediateId)`\n\n## I need lots of timers and want to use linked list timers as Node.js does.\n\nLinked lists are efficient when you have thousands (millions?) of timers with the same delay.\nTake a look at [timers-browserify-full](https://www.npmjs.com/package/timers-browserify-full) in this case.\n\n# License\n\n[MIT](http://jryans.mit-license.org/)\n",
