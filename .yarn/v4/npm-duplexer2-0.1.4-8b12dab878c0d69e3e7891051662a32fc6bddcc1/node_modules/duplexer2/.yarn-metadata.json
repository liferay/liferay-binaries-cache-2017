Everything largely\nworks the same.\n\n\n\n## Installation\n\n[Available via `npm`](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/install):\n\n```\n$ npm i duplexer2\n```\n\n## API\n\n### duplexer2\n\nCreates a new `DuplexWrapper` object, which is the actual class that implements\nmost of the fun stuff. All that fun stuff is hidden. DON'T LOOK.\n\n```javascript\nduplexer2([options], writable, readable)\n```\n\n```javascript\nconst duplex = duplexer2(new stream.Writable(), new stream.Readable());\n```\n\nArguments\n\n* __options__ - an object specifying the regular `stream.Duplex` options, as\n  well as the properties described below.\n* __writable__ - a writable stream\n* __readable__ - a readable stream\n\nOptions\n\n* __bubbleErrors__ - a boolean value that specifies whether to bubble errors\n  from the underlying readable/writable streams. Default is `true`.\n\n\n## License\n\n3-clause BSD.
