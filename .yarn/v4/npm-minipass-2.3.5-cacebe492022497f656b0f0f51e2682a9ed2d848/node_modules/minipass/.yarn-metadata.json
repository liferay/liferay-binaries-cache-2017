    "readme": "# minipass\n\nA _very_ minimal implementation of a [PassThrough\nstream](https://nodejs.org/api/stream.html#stream_class_stream_passthrough)\n\n[It's very\nfast](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1oObKSrVwLX_7Ut4Z6g3fZW-AX1j1-k6w-cDsrkaSbHM/edit#gid=0)\nfor objects, strings, and buffers.\n\nSupports pipe()ing (including multi-pipe() and backpressure\ntransmission), buffering data until either a `data` event handler or\n`pipe()` is added (so you don't lose the first chunk), and most other\ncases where PassThrough is a good idea.\n\nThere is a `read()` method, but it's much more efficient to consume\ndata from this stream via `'data'` events or by calling `pipe()` into\nsome other stream.  Calling `read()` requires the buffer to be\nflattened in some cases, which requires copying memory.\n\nThere is also no `unpipe()` method.  Once you start piping, there is\nno stopping it!\n\nIf you set `objectMode: true` in the options, then whatever is written\nwill be emitted.  Otherwise, it'll do a minimal amount of Buffer\ncopying to ensure proper Streams semantics when `read(n)` is called.\n\nThis is not a `through` or `through2` stream.  It doesn't transform\nthe data, it just passes it right through.  If you want to transform\nthe data, extend the class, and override the `write()` method.  Once\nyou're done transforming the data however you want, call\n`super.write()` with the transform output.\n\nFor an example of a stream that extends MiniPass to provide transform\ncapabilities, check out [minizlib](http://npm.im/minizlib).\n\n## USAGE\n\n```js\nconst MiniPass = require('minipass')\nconst mp = new MiniPass(options) // optional: { encoding }\nmp.write('foo')\nmp.pipe(someOtherStream)\nmp.end('bar')\n```\n\n### collecting\n\n```js\nmp.collect().then(all => {\n  // all is an array of all the data emitted\n  // encoding is supported in this case, so\n  // so the result will be a collection of strings if\n  // an encoding is specified, or buffers/objects if not.\n  //\n  // In an async function, you may do\n  // const data = await stream.collect()\n})\n```\n\n### iteration\n\nYou can iterate over streams synchronously or asynchronously in\nplatforms that support it.\n\nSynchronous iteration will end when the currently available data is\nconsumed, even if the `end` event has not been reached.  In string and\nbuffer mode, the data is concatenated, so unless multiple writes are\noccurring in the same tick as the `read()`, sync iteration loops will\ngenerally only have a single iteration.\n\nTo consume chunks in this way exactly as they have been written, with\nno flattening, create the stream with the `{ objectMode: true }`\noption.\n\n```js\nconst mp = new Minipass({ objectMode: true })\nmp.write('a')\nmp.write('b')\nfor (let letter of mp) {\n  console.log(letter) // a, b\n}\nmp.write('c')\nmp.write('d')\nfor (let letter of mp) {\n  console.log(letter) // c, d\n}\nmp.write('e')\nmp.end()\nfor (let letter of mp) {\n  console.log(letter) // e\n}\nfor (let letter of mp) {\n  console.log(letter) // nothing\n}\n```\n\nAsynchronous iteration will continue until the end event is reached,\nconsuming all of the data.\n\n```js\nconst mp = new Minipass({ encoding: 'utf8' })\n\n// some source of some data\nlet i = 5\nconst inter = setInterval(() => {\n  if (i --> 0)\n    mp.write(Buffer.from('foo\\n', 'utf8'))\n  else {\n    mp.end()\n    clearInterval(inter)\n  }\n}, 100)\n\n// consume the data with asynchronous iteration\nasync function consume () {\n  for await (let chunk of mp) {\n    console.log(chunk)\n  }\n  return 'ok'\n}\n\nconsume().then(res => console.log(res))\n// logs `foo\\n` 5 times, and then `ok`\n```\n",
