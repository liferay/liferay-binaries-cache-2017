    "readme": "streamroller\n============\n\nnode.js file streams that roll over when they reach a maximum size, or a date/time.\n\n        npm install streamroller\n\n## usage\n\n        var rollers = require('streamroller');\n        var stream = new rollers.RollingFileStream('myfile', 1024, 3);\n        stream.write(\"stuff\");\n        stream.end();\n\nThe streams behave the same as standard node.js streams, except that when certain conditions are met they will rename the current file to a backup and start writing to a new file.\n\n### new RollingFileStream(filename [, maxSize, numBackups, options])\n* `filename` (String)\n* `maxSize` - the size in bytes to trigger a rollover, if not provided this defaults to MAX_SAFE_INTEGER and the stream will not roll.\n* `numBackups` - the number of old files to keep\n* `options` - Object\n  * `encoding` - defaults to 'utf8'\n  * `mode` - defaults to 0644\n  * `flags` - defaults to 'a'\n  * `compress` - (boolean) defaults to `false` - compress the backup files using gzip (files will have `.gz` extension).\n  * `keepFileExt` - (boolean) defaults to `false` - keep the file original extension. e.g.: `abc.log -> abc.1.log`.\n\nThis returns a `WritableStream`. When the current file being written to (given by `filename`) gets up to or larger than `maxSize`, then the current file will be renamed to `filename.1` and a new file will start being written to. Up to `numBackups` of old files are maintained, so if `numBackups` is 3 then there will be 4 files:\n<pre>\n     filename\n     filename.1\n     filename.2\n     filename.3\n</pre>\nWhen filename size >= maxSize then:\n<pre>\n     filename -> filename.1\n     filename.1 -> filename.2\n     filename.2 -> filename.3\n     filename.3 gets overwritten\n     filename is a new file\n</pre>\n\n### new DateRollingFileStream(filename, pattern, options)\n* `filename` (String)\n* `pattern` (String) - the date pattern to trigger rolling (see below)\n* `options` - Object\n\t* `encoding` - defaults to 'utf8'\n\t* `mode` defaults to 0644\n\t* `flags` defaults to 'a'\n    * `compress` - (boolean) compress the backup files, defaults to false\n    * `keepFileExt` - (boolean) defaults to `false` - keep the file original extension. e.g.: `abc.log -> abc.2013-08-30.log`.\n\t* `alwaysIncludePattern` - (boolean) extend the initial file with the pattern, defaults to false\n  * `daysToKeep` - (integer) if this is greater than 0, then files older than `daysToKeep` days will be deleted during file rolling.\n\n\nThis returns a `WritableStream`. When the current time, formatted as `pattern`, changes then the current file will be renamed to `filename.formattedDate` where `formattedDate` is the result of processing the date through the pattern, and a new file will begin to be written. Streamroller uses [date-format](http://github.com/nomiddlename/date-format) to format dates, and the `pattern` should use the date-format format. e.g. with a `pattern` of `\".yyyy-MM-dd\"`, and assuming today is August 29, 2013 then writing to the stream today will just write to `filename`. At midnight (or more precisely, at the next file write after midnight), `filename` will be renamed to `filename.2013-08-29` and a new `filename` will be created. If `options.alwaysIncludePattern` is true, then the initial file will be `filename.2013-08-29` and no renaming will occur at midnight, but a new file will be written to with the name `filename.2013-08-30`.\n",
