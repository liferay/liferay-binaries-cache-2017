All Rights Reserved.\n *\n * Promise support is not ready on all supported browsers,\n * therefore core.js is temporarily using Google's promises as polyfill. It\n * supports cancellable promises and has clean and fast implementation.\n */\n ```\n\n## Use\n\n### Simple use case\n\n```javascript\nimport CancellablePromise from 'metal-promise';\n\nnew CancellablePromise(function(resolve, reject) {\n  asyncFunction(function(err) {\n    if (err) {\n      reject(err);\n    }\n    else {\n      resolve();\n    }\n  });\n})\n.then(function() {\n  // Invoked once resolved\n})\n.catch(function(err) {\n  // Invoked once rejected\n});\n```\n\n### Progress tracking\n\nIn addition to Google Closure's implementation of Promise,\nthe `ProgressPromise` class is also provided for tracking the progress of an\nasync process.\n\n```javascript\nimport {ProgressPromise} from 'metal-promise';\n\nnew ProgressPromise(function(resolve, reject, progress) {\n  progress(0.3);\n  progress(0.5);\n  progress(0.7);\n  progress(0.9);\n\n  setTimeout(function() {\n    resolve();\n  }, 100);\n})\n.progress(progress => {\n  // Will invoke 4 times, 0.3, 0.5, 0.7, 0.9\n})\n.then(function() {\n  // Invoked after all progress calls\n});\n```\n\nNote that the `progress` function must be invoked with a number\nbetween `0` and `1`.\n\n```javascript\nprogress(2); // TypeError: The progress percentage should be a number between 0 and 1\n```\n\nIt also cannot be invoked with a smaller number than the previous call.\n\n```javascript\nprogress(0.3);\nprogress(0.1); // Error: The progress percentage can't be lower than the previous percentage\n```\n\n### Advanced use cases\n\nTo see more advanced documentation, please visit Google Closure\nLibrary's [documentation](https://google.github.io/closure-library/api/goog.Promise.html);\n\n## Setup\n\n1. Install a recent release of [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) if you\ndon't have it yet.\n\n2. Install local dependencies:\n\n  ```\n  npm install\n  ```\n\n3. Run the tests:\n\n  ```\n  npm test\n  ```\n\n## Contributing\n\nCheck out the [contributing guidelines](https://github.com/metal/metal-plugins/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) for more information.\n",
