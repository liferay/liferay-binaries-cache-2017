As such\nthis project is mostly _internal_ and support is _minimal_.  For certain\nissues, like build integration we are in an especially bad position to offer\nsupport.\n\nTo get assistance you can use any of the following forums\n\n1. Look through the [documentation](https://sennajs.com).\n2. File an [issue on GitHub](https://github.com/liferay/senna.js/issues)\n\nWe will try our best, but keep in mind that given our support staffing, we may\nnot be able to help.\n\n## Install\n\nInstall via [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/), [Bower](http://bower.io/), [CDN](http://www.jsdelivr.com/projects/senna.js) or\n[download as a zip](https://github.com/liferay/senna.js/archive/master.zip):\n\n```\nnpm install senna\n```\n\n## Examples\n\n* **[Email Example](http://sennajs.com/examples/email):** *Enable Single Page Apps using only HTML5 data-attributes;*\n* **[Gallery Example](http://sennajs.com/examples/gallery):** *Carousel app with history support and cacheable screens;*\n* **[Blog Example](http://sennajs.com/examples/blog):** *Infinite scrolling pages done right with history support;*\n\n## Setup\n\n1. Install NodeJS >= [v0.12.0](http://nodejs.org/dist/v0.12.0/), if you don't have it yet.\n\n2. Install global dependencies:\n\n  ```\n  [sudo] npm install -g gulp\n  ```\n\n3. Install local dependencies:\n\n  ```\n  npm install\n  bower install\n  ```\n\n4. Build the code:\n\n  ```\n  gulp\n  ```\n\n  ```\n  gulp server\n  ```\n\n5. Test the code:\n\n  ```\n  gulp test\n  ```\n\n  ```\n  gulp test:coverage\n  ```\n\n## Contributing\n\nPlease, see our detailed [CONTRIBUTING](https://github.com/liferay/senna.js/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) guide for all the information you need to contribute to the project!\n\n## History\n\nFor detailed changelog, check [Releases](https://github.com/liferay/senna.js/releases).\n\n## Credits\n\n* Inspired by Daniel Pupius' [Surface project](https://github.com/dpup/surface)\n* Demo layouts by [Pure CSS](http://purecss.io/)\n* Icon made by [Freepik](http://www.freepik.com)\n\n## Team\n\n*Senna.js* was made with love by these people and a bunch of [awesome contributors](https://github.com/liferay/senna.js/graphs/contributors).\n\n| Author | Maintainer |\n|:-:|:-:|\n| [![Eduardo Lundgren](https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/113087?s=70)](https://github.com/eduardolundgren) | [![Bruno Basto](https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/156388?s=70)](https://github.com/brunobasto) |\n| [Eduardo Lundgren](https://github.com/eduardolundgren) | [Bruno Basto](https://github.com/brunobasto) |\n\n## Browser Support\n\n[![Sauce Test Status](https://saucelabs.com/browser-matrix/senna.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/liferay/senna.js)\n\n## License\n\n[BSD License](https://github.com/liferay/senna.js/blob/master/LICENSE.md) © Liferay, Inc.\n",
