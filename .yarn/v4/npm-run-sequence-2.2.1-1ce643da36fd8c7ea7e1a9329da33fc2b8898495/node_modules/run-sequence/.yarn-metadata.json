This function is designed to solve the situation where you have defined run-order, but choose not to or cannot use dependencies.\n\n> ### Is your company hiring Node developers?\n>\n> If you are hiring developers, you can support this project and future open source work by checking out our company, [Qualified.io](https://www.qualified.io/?utm_source=run-sequence).\n>\n> Qualified is a service for online skills-assessment that can help you easily vet developers across a wide range of real-world programming skills.\n>\n> Please help support this project, and [sign up for a free trial](https://www.qualified.io/?utm_source=run-sequence).\n\n\n\nEach argument to `run-sequence` is run in order.  This works by listening to the `task_stop` and `task_err` events, and keeping track of which tasks have been completed.  You can still run some of the tasks in parallel, by providing an array of task names for one or more of the arguments.\n\nIf the final argument is a function, it will be used as a callback after all the functions are either finished or an error has occurred.\n\n> **Please Note**\n>\n> This was intended to be a temporary solution until the release of gulp 4.0 which should have support for defining task dependencies similarly.\n> \n> Given that Gulp 4 appears to never be fully released, take that for what you will. Be aware that this solution is a hack, and may stop working with a future update to gulp.\n\n## Usage\n\nFirst, install `run-sequence` as a development dependency:\n\n```shell\nnpm install --save-dev run-sequence\n```\n\nThen add use it in your gulpfile, like so (note these are only examples, please check the documentation for your functions for the correct way to use them):\n\n```js\nvar gulp = require('gulp');\nvar runSequence = require('run-sequence');\nvar del = require('del');\nvar fs = require('fs');\n\n// This will run in this order:\n// * build-clean\n// * build-scripts and build-styles in parallel\n// * build-html\n// * Finally call the callback function\ngulp.task('build', function(callback) {\n  runSequence('build-clean',\n              ['build-scripts', 'build-styles'],\n              'build-html',\n              callback);\n});\n\n// configure build-clean, build-scripts, build-styles, build-html as you wish,\n// but make sure they either return a stream or promise, or handle the callback\n// Example:\n\ngulp.task('build-clean', function() {\n    // Return the Promise from del()\n    return del([BUILD_DIRECTORY]);\n//  ^^^^^^\n//   This is the key here, to make sure asynchronous tasks are done!\n});\n\ngulp.task('build-scripts', function() {\n    // Return the stream from gulp\n    return gulp.src(SCRIPTS_SRC).pipe(...)...\n//  ^^^^^^\n//   This is the key here, to make sure tasks run to completion!\n});\n\ngulp.task('callback-example', function(callback) {\n    // Use the callback in the async function\n    fs.readFile('...', function(err, file) {\n        console.log(file);\n        callback();\n//      ^^^^^^^^^^\n//       This is what lets gulp know this task is complete!\n    });\n});\n```\n\n### Using within gulp submodules\n\nIf you have a complex gulp setup with your tasks split up across different files, you may get the error that `run-sequence` is unable to find your tasks.  In this case, you can configure `run-sequence` to look at the gulp within the submodule, like so:\n\n```js\n// submodule tasks/mygulptask.js\n\nvar gulp = require('gulp'), // might be a different instance than the toplevel one\n    // this uses the gulp you provide\n    runSequence = require('run-sequence').use(gulp);\n    \n    // ...and then use normally\n    runSequence('subtask1', 'subtask2');\n```\n\n## Options\n\nThere are a few global options you can configure on the `runSequence` function.\n\nPlease note these are **global to the module**, and once set will affect every use of `runSequence`.\n\nUsage:\n\n```js\nvar runSequence = require('run-sequence');\nrunSequence.options.ignoreUndefinedTasks = true;\ngulp.task('task', function(cb) {\n\trunSequence('foo', null, 'bar'); // no longer errors on `null`\n})\n```\n\n- `showErrorStackTrace`: When set to `false`, this suppresses the full stack trace from errors captured during a sequence.\n- `ignoreUndefinedTasks`: When set to `true`, this enables you to pass falsey values in which will be stripped from the task set before validation and sequencing.\n\n\n\n## LICENSE\n\n[MIT License](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIT_License)\n\n\n[npm-url]: https://npmjs.org/package/run-sequence\n[npm-image]: https://badge.fury.io/js/run-sequence.png\n\n[travis-url]: http://travis-ci.org/OverZealous/run-sequence\n[travis-image]: https://secure.travis-ci.org/OverZealous/run-sequence.png?branch=master\n",
