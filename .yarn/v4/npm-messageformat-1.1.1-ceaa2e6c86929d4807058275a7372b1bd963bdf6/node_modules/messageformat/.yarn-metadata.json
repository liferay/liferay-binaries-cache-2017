ICU MessageFormat is a mechanism for handling both **pluralization** and **gender** in your applications. It can also lead to much better translations, as it's designed to support [all the languages](http://www.unicode.org/cldr/charts/latest/supplemental/language_plural_rules.html) included in the [Unicode CLDR](http://cldr.unicode.org/).\n\nThe ICU has an [official guide](http://userguide.icu-project.org/formatparse/messages) for the format. Messageformat supports and extends all parts of the [standard](http://icu-project.org/apiref/icu4j/com/ibm/icu/text/MessageFormat.html), with the exception of the deprecated ChoiceFormat.\n\nThere is a good slide-deck on [Plural and Gender in Translated Messages](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1ZyN8-0VXmod5hbHveq-M1AeQ61Ga3BmVuahZjbmbBxo/pub?start=false&loop=false&delayms=3000#slide=id.g1bc43a82_2_14) by Markus Scherer and Mark Davis. But, again, remember that many of these problems apply even if you're only outputting english.\n\nPlease see [messageformat.github.io](https://messageformat.github.io/) for a guide to MessageFormat, more information on on the build-time use of messageformat, and the code documentation.\n\n\n## What problems does it solve?\n\nUsing messageformat, you can separate your code from your text formatting, while enabling much more humane expressions. In other words, you won't need to see this anymore in your output:\n\n> There are 1 results.  \n> There are 1 result(s).  \n> Number of results: 5.\n\n\n## What does it look like?\n\nWith this message:\n\n```js\n> const msg = `{GENDER, select, male{He} female{She} other{They} } found\n  {RES, plural, =0{no results} one{1 result} other{# results} } in the\n  {CAT, selectordinal, one{#st} two{#nd} few{#rd} other{#th} } category.`;\n```\n\nYou'll get these results:\n\n```js\n> const mfunc = new MessageFormat('en').compile(msg);\n\n> mfunc({ GENDER: 'male', RES: 1, CAT: 2 })\n'He found 1 result in the 2nd category.'\n\n> mfunc({ GENDER: 'female', RES: 1, CAT: 2 })\n'She found 1 result in the 2nd category.'\n\n> mfunc({ GENDER: 'male', RES: 2, CAT: 1 })\n'He found 2 results in the 1st category.'\n\n> mfunc({ RES: 2, CAT: 2 })\n'They found 2 results in the 2nd category.'\n```\n\n\n## Features\n\n* Handles arbitrary nesting of pluralization and select rules\n* Supports all ~466 languages included in the Unicode CLDR\n* Works on the server and the client\n* Remarkably useful even for single-language use\n* Speed & efficiency: Can pre-compile messages to JavaScript code\n  * Great for speed: message formatting is just string concatenation\n* Compatible with other MessageFormat implementations\n* Extendable with custom formatting functions\n* Very whitespace tolerant\n* Supports Unicode\n\n\n## Installation\n\n### Node\n```\nnpm install messageformat\n```\n\n```js\nconst MessageFormat = require('messageformat');\nconst mf = new MessageFormat('en');\n```\n\n### Bower\n```\nbower install messageformat\n```\n\n```html\n<script src=\"path/to/bower_components/messageformat/messageformat.js\"></script>\n<script>\n  const mf = new MessageFormat('en');\n</script>\n```\n\n### Git / Direct download\nThe tagged [releases](https://github.com/messageformat/messageformat.js/releases) available on github.com include all of the compiled files that are kept off the master branch of the repository. When working with a clone of the repository, you'll likely want to run `make all` to generate them yourself.\n\n\n## License\n\nYou may use this software under the MIT License.\n\n## Contributor License Agreement\n\nWe require all contributions to be covered under the JS Foundation's [Contributor License Agreement](https://js.foundation/CLA/).
