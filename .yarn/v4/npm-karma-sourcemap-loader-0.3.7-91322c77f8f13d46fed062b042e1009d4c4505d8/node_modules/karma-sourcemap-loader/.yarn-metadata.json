    "readme": "# karma-sourcemap-loader\n\n> Preprocessor that locates and loads existing source maps.\n\n## Why\n\nWhen you use karma not in isolation but as part of a build process (e.g. using grunt\nor gulp) it is often the case that the compilation/transpilation is done on a previous\nstep of the process and not handled by karma preprocessors. In these cases source maps\ndon't get loaded by karma and you lose the advantages of having them.\n\n## How it works\n\nThis plug-in supports both inline and external source maps.\n\nInline source maps are located by searching \"sourceMappingURL=\" inside the javascript\nfile, both plain text and base64-encoded maps are supported.\n\nExternal source maps are located by appending \".map\" to the javascript file name.\nSo if for example you have Hello.js, the preprocessor will try to load source map from\nHello.js.map.\n\n## Installation\n\nJust add `karma-sourcemap-loader` as a devDependency in your `package.json`.\n```json\n{\n  \"devDependencies\": {\n    \"karma-sourcemap-loader\": \"~0.3\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\nOr issue the following command:\n```bash\nnpm install karma-sourcemap-loader --save-dev\n```\n\n## Configuration\n\nThe code below shows a sample configuration of the preprocessor.\n```js\n// karma.conf.js\nmodule.exports = function(config) {\n  config.set({\n    preprocessors: {\n      '**/*.js': ['sourcemap']\n    }\n  });\n};\n```",
