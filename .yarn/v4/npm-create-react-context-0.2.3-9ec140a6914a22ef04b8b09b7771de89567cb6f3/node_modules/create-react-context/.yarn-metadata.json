    "readme": "# create-react-context\n\n> Polyfill for the [proposed React context API](https://github.com/reactjs/rfcs/pull/2)\n\n## Install\n\n```sh\nyarn add create-react-context\n```\n\nYou'll need to also have `react` and `prop-types` installed.\n\n## API\n\n```js\nconst Context = createReactContext(defaultValue);\n// <Context.Provider value={providedValue}>{children}</Context.Provider>\n// ...\n// <Context.Consumer>{value => children}</Context.Consumer>\n```\n\n## Example\n\n```js\n// @flow\nimport React, { type Node } from 'react';\nimport createReactContext, { type Context } from 'create-react-context';\n\ntype Theme = 'light' | 'dark';\n// Pass a default theme to ensure type correctness\nconst ThemeContext: Context<Theme> = createReactContext('light');\n\nclass ThemeToggler extends React.Component<\n  { children: Node },\n  { theme: Theme }\n> {\n  state = { theme: 'light' };\n  render() {\n    return (\n      // Pass the current context value to the Provider's `value` prop.\n      // Changes are detected using strict comparison (Object.is)\n      <ThemeContext.Provider value={this.state.theme}>\n        <button\n          onClick={() => {\n            this.setState(state => ({\n              theme: state.theme === 'light' ? 'dark' : 'light'\n            }));\n          }}\n        >\n          Toggle theme\n        </button>\n        {this.props.children}\n      </ThemeContext.Provider>\n    );\n  }\n}\n\nclass Title extends React.Component<{ children: Node }> {\n  render() {\n    return (\n      // The Consumer uses a render prop API. Avoids conflicts in the\n      // props namespace.\n      <ThemeContext.Consumer>\n        {theme => (\n          <h1 style={{ color: theme === 'light' ? '#000' : '#fff' }}>\n            {this.props.children}\n          </h1>\n        )}\n      </ThemeContext.Consumer>\n    );\n  }\n}\n```\n\n## Compatibility\n\nThis package only \"ponyfills\" the `React.createContext` API, not other\nunrelated React 16+ APIs. If you are using a version of React <16, keep\nin mind that you can only use features available in that version.\n\nFor example, you cannot pass children types aren't valid pre React 16:\n\n```js\n<Context.Provider>\n  <div/>\n  <div/>\n</Context.Provider>\n```\n\nIt will throw `A valid React element (or null) must be returned. You may have returned undefined, an array or some other invalid object.` because `<Context.Provider>` can only receive a single child element. To fix the error just wrap everyting in a single `<div>`:\n\n```js\n<Context.Provider>\n  <div>\n    <div/>\n    <div/>\n  </div>\n</Context.Provider>\n```\n",
